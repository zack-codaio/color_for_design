Overview:
- The first page that opens is a "hub" page to each of the topics I am trying to teach
    - information hierarchy is not included yet
- Color basics and color schemes are currently mostly just an information dump
- Formative assessments are present in cultural color association and critique
- Audio in critique works
- audio in personal associations does not work.  It doesn't work on the emulator so I commented it all out.
- Want to add more formative assessments within the informational parts
- Educational principles being used are segmenting, compared examples, multimedia, and explanatory feedback.

Missteps:
- Spent a while trying to get a ViewPager set up to handle swiping between views but cannot for the life of me get it to build properly. That's why everything is just paged together in separate activities instead.
- Audio recording does not work on the emulator as per this page: https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/audio-capture.html
    - I tried to start up my old GS3 to try it on there but it did not want to boot properly
- I started from the end and more or less worked my way forward. The critique / color association ones have several pages that should have just swapped views instead of starting new activities. I fixed this in basic concepts and color schemes but didn't have time to go back and fix it for the other sections

    This is based on my project for E-Learning Design Principles with Professor Ken Koedinger. My partner for that project was Qian Hu, who did some of the mock ups.
